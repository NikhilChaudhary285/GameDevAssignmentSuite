### Assembly Definitions

Each module has its own `.asmdef` enforcing hard architectural boundaries:

```
Common.asmdef           ← Base interfaces and utilities
CoinChange.asmdef       ← references Common
ScrollMenu.asmdef       ← references Common
ImageDownloader.asmdef  ← references Common
```

> \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*Why Assembly Definitions?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* They prevent accidental cross-module dependencies. `ScrollMenu` cannot accidentally import `ImageDownloader` internals. Compile-time enforcement of architecture.

## 🧮 Task 1 — Coin Change Algorithm

### Problem Statement

Given a cash counter with unlimited notes of given denominations, find **how many distinct ways** you can make change for a given amount. Order does **not** matter — `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1,5]` and `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5,1]` count as one way.

```csharp
public int GetChange(int\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[] notes, int amount)
```

### Algorithm — Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming

This is the classic **Coin Change 2 / Unbounded Knapsack** problem solved with combination-counting DP.

```
dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[0] = 1          ← One way to make 0: use nothing
dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[i] = 0          ← All other amounts start at 0

For each coin denomination:
    For amount = coin → target:
        dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[amount] += dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[amount - coin]
```

**Time Complexity:** `O(n × amount)` where n = number of denominations
**Space Complexity:** `O(amount)` — single 1D array

#### Why Loop Order Matters (Key Interview Point)

```
Outer = COINS, Inner = AMOUNTS  →  COMBINATIONS  ✅ (our requirement)
Outer = AMOUNTS, Inner = COINS  →  PERMUTATIONS  ❌ (counts \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1,5] and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5,1] separately)
```

#### Algorithm Trace — `notes=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1,10], amount=20 → 3`

```
Init:  dp = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0]   (size 21)

Coin = 1:
  amt=1:  dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1]  += dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[0]  →  1   (one way: 1×1)
  amt=2:  dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[2]  += dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1]  →  1   (one way: 2×1)
  ...
  amt=20: dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[20] += dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[19] →  1   (one way: 20×1)

Coin = 10:
  amt=10: dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10] += dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[0]  →  1+1=2  (10×1  OR  1×10)
  amt=11: dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[11] += dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1]  →  1+1=2
  ...
  amt=20: dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[20] += dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10] →  1+2=3  ✅

Result: dp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[20] = 3
Ways:   \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[20×1]  |  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10×1 + 1×10]  |  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[2×10]
```

### Verified Test Cases

|Input Notes|Amount|Expected|Result|Status|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1, 10]`|`20`|`3`|`3`|✅ PASS|
|`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1, 5, 10]`|`20`|`9`|`9`|✅ PASS|
|`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[2, 5, 10]`|`100`|`66`|`66`|✅ PASS|
|`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1, 5, 10]`|`0`|`1`|`1`|✅ PASS|
|`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5]`|`23`|`0`|`0`|✅ PASS|
|`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3, 7]`|`5`|`0`|`0`|✅ PASS|
|`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1, 2]`|`4`|`3`|`3`|✅ PASS|
|`null`|`20`|`-1`|`-1`|✅ PASS|
|`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1, 5]`|`-5`|`-1`|`-1`|✅ PASS|

### Key Design Decisions

```csharp
// WHY long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[] not int\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[]?
// Number of combinations can exceed int.MaxValue for large inputs.
// Example: notes=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1,2,3], amount=500 → astronomically large.
// We clamp to int.MaxValue on return to maintain interface contract.
long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[] dp = new long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[amount + 1];
```

### Zero Unity Dependency

`CoinChangeService` is a **pure C# class** with zero Unity dependency. You can run it in:

* Unity Editor
* NUnit / xUnit test runner
* Any .NET Standard 2.1 application
* Console app for benchmarking

## 📱 Task 2 — Touch Scroll Menu

### What It Is

A **horizontal swipe-snap level selection menu** — the exact pattern used in mobile games like Angry Birds, Candy Crush, and Subway Surfers. Built from scratch using Unity UGUI without any third-party plugins.

### Features

* **Swipe** left/right to navigate cards (touch + mouse)
* **Snap** to nearest card on release (ease-out cubic animation)
* **Scale animation** — center card = 1.0×, side cards = 0.85×
* **Alpha fade** — center card = full opacity, sides = 65%
* **Pagination dots** — active dot is larger and brighter
* **Prev/Next buttons** — gray out at boundaries
* **Locked levels** — overlay with lock icon, disabled play button
* **Star ratings** — 0–3 stars per level
* **Dynamic generation** — cards spawned from `LevelData` list at runtime

### Architecture — MVC Pattern

```
LevelDataProvider  →  provides List<LevelData>
        ↓
ScrollMenuController (Pure C#)
  - Holds current page index
  - Processes swipe delta and velocity
  - Fires OnPageChanged event
        ↓ (event)
ScrollMenuView (MonoBehaviour)
  - Spawns card prefabs
  - Moves content RectTransform
  - Delegates to sub-components
        ├── CardScaleAnimator  →  lerps scale + alpha each frame
        ├── PaginationDots     →  updates dot visuals
        └── LevelCard\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[]        →  each card renders its own LevelData
```

### Swipe Physics

```csharp
// Fast swipe detection — direction alone decides page
bool fastSwipe = Mathf.Abs(velocity) > 500f; // pixels/sec

// Slow drag — must cross 20% of card width to trigger page change
float dragFraction = accumulatedDrag / cardWidth;
bool slowSwipe = Mathf.Abs(dragFraction) > 0.2f;

// Neither → snap back to current card
```

### Snap Animation — Ease-Out Cubic

```csharp
// Feels snappy: fast start, smooth landing
// t=0.0 → position at start
// t=1.0 → position at target
// The cubic curve makes it decelerate naturally
float t = 1f - Mathf.Pow(1f - (elapsed / duration), 3f);
float newX = Mathf.Lerp(startX, targetX, t);
```

### Aspect Ratio Support

```csharp
// Card width scales proportionally to viewport width
// Capped at 500px to prevent oversized cards on tablets
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_cardWidth   = Mathf.Min(screenWidth \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* 0.65f, 500f);
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_cardSpacing = screenWidth \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* 0.15f;
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_cardStep    = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_cardWidth + \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_cardSpacing;

// Result: always shows 1 full center card + 2 partial side cards
// at any aspect ratio from 9:16 (iPhone) to 3:4 (iPad)
```

|Aspect Ratio|Device|Behavior|
|-|-|-|
|`9:16`|iPhone SE, most Androids|✅ Full card + partial sides|
|`9:19.5`|iPhone 14 Pro, modern phones|✅ Scales correctly|
|`3:4`|iPad|✅ Wider cards, proportional spacing|
|`2:3`|Older phones|✅ No layout breaks|

## 🌐 Task 3 — Image Download System

### What It Is

A **drop-in, reusable image management system** for Unity. Attach `WebImage.cs` to any UI Image, set a URL, and the system handles everything — concurrency, caching, fallback, and memory management.

### System Flow

```
WebImage.SetUrl(url)
        │
        ▼
ImageDownloader.Instance.RequestImage(url, callback, useMemoryCache)
        │
        ├─ Tier 1: Memory Cache ──────────────── Hit? → callback(texture) instantly
        │          Dictionary<url, Texture2D>
        │
        ├─ Tier 2: Disk Cache ────────────────── Hit? → load PNG → callback (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\~5ms)
        │          persistentDataPath/ImageCache/
        │          {MD5(url)}.png + cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_index.json
        │
        └─ Tier 3: Network ───────────────────── DownloadQueue → RequestHandler
                   UnityWebRequest                → Texture2D (RGBA32)
                                                  → Save to disk
                                                  → Store in memory
                                                  → callback(texture)
```

### Concurrency System

```
Queue State at any moment:

  ACTIVE SLOTS (max 3):   \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[Download A] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[Download B] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[Download C]
  PENDING QUEUE:          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[D] → \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[E] → \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[F] → \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[G] ...

  When A completes:       \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[Download B] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[Download C] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[Download D]
  Pending count:          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[E] → \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[F] → \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[G] ...
```

#### 10-Second Override Rule

```
Priority Rules (in order of importance):
  1. No request waits more than 10 seconds
  2. No more than 3 concurrent downloads
  Rule 1 beats Rule 2.

Override mechanism:
  If oldest\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_pending.WaitTime > 10s:
    → If free slot exists: promote normally
    → If no free slot: ABORT oldest active download
                       → notify its WebImage (shows fallback)
                       → give freed slot to long-waiting request
```

#### Request Coalescing

```
WebImage\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_A requests: "https://cdn.example.com/hero.png"
WebImage\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_B requests: "https://cdn.example.com/hero.png"  ← same URL!

WITHOUT coalescing: 2 HTTP requests, 2 downloads, race conditions
WITH coalescing:    1 HTTP request, both callbacks fire on completion
                    Zero duplicate downloads regardless of timing
```

### Cache System

#### Memory Cache

```
Type:     Dictionary<string url, Texture2D texture>
Speed:    O(1) lookup — instant
Lifetime: Current app session (cleared on app restart)
Control:  Per-WebImage boolean — \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_useMemoryCache
```

#### Disk Cache

```
Location: Application.persistentDataPath/ImageCache/
Format:   {MD5(url)}.png  +  cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_index.json
Expiry:   7 days (configurable via Inspector)
On load:  Checks expiry → loads bytes → creates Texture2D → promotes to memory
```

#### Why MD5 for filenames?

```
URL:  "https://cdn.example.com/images/hero\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_portrait\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_v2.png?token=abc123"
MD5:  "a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4"
File: "a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4.png"

Reason: URLs contain characters invalid in filenames (/, ?, =, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&).
        MD5 gives a fixed-length, filesystem-safe, collision-resistant name.
```

### Alpha Image Support

```csharp
// WHY TextureFormat.RGBA32 and not RGB24 or DXT:
//
// RGB24   → No alpha channel. PNG transparency is LOST.
// DXT1/5  → Compressed, but not supported on all mobile GPUs.
// RGBA32  → Full alpha support, universal compatibility, correct for UI.

Texture2D texture = new Texture2D(2, 2, TextureFormat.RGBA32, mipChain: false);
texture.LoadImage(rawBytes);  // auto-resizes, preserves alpha
```

### WebImage Component

Drop `WebImage.cs` onto any UI `Image` GameObject:

```
Inspector Fields:
  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[URL]
    string url              → set in Inspector or call SetUrl() from code
    bool   loadOnStart      → auto-load on Start() if true

  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[Sprites]
    Sprite loadingSprite    → shown while downloading
    Sprite fallbackSprite   → shown if download fails

  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[Aspect]
    bool preserveAspect     → maintain image proportions

  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[Caching]
    bool useMemoryCache     → cache this image in RAM after download

  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[Debug]
    bool showDebugState     → verbose logging for this component
```

```csharp
// Usage from code:
webImage.SetUrl("https://example.com/image.png");
webImage.Clear();  // reset to fallback
Debug.Log(webImage.State);  // Idle / Loading / Loaded / Failed
```

### Performance Characteristics

|Scenario|Latency|Network Requests|
|-|-|-|
|Memory cache hit|`< 1ms`|0|
|Disk cache hit|`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\~ 5ms`|0|
|Already downloading (coalesced)|`variable`|0 (shared)|
|Fresh download|`network latency`|1|
|Fresh download (queue full)|`network latency + queue wait`|1|

## 🎨 Design Patterns Used

|Pattern|Where Used|Why|
|-|-|-|
|**Singleton**|`ImageDownloader`|One global download manager, persists across scenes|
|**Strategy**|`CardScaleAnimator`|Swap animation style without touching menu logic|
|**Observer / Event**|`IScrollMenuController.OnPageChanged`|Decouples navigation from visual updates|
|**Repository**|`LevelDataProvider`|Swap data source (JSON, server, ScriptableObject) without touching UI|

## ✅ SOLID Principles Applied

### Single Responsibility Principle

```
CoinChangeService     → only computes coin change
CacheManager          → only manages cache (not downloads)
DownloadQueue         → only manages concurrency (not HTTP)
RequestHandler        → only makes HTTP requests (not caching)
WebImage              → only manages one UI Image display
PaginationDots        → only renders dots (not navigation)
LevelCard             → only renders one card's visual state
```

### Open/Closed Principle

```
Add new cache tier (CDN)?      → New ICacheManager implementation. Zero changes to ImageDownloader.
Add new animation style?       → New CardScaleAnimator. Zero changes to ScrollMenuView.
Add new coin change algorithm? → New ICoinChangeService impl. Zero changes to UI or tests.
```

### Liskov Substitution Principle

```
MockCacheManager can replace CacheManager     → same behavior from outside
MockImageDownloader can replace ImageDownloader → unit-testable WebImage
```

### Interface Segregation Principle

```
IImageDownloader → only: RequestImage, Cancel, Clear, stats (4 methods)
ICacheManager    → only: memory ops + disk ops + maintenance (8 methods)
IScrollMenuController → only: GoToNext, GoPrev, GoToIndex, drag events (6 methods)
WebImage never sees DownloadQueue, CacheManager, or RequestHandler internals.
```

### Dependency Inversion Principle

```
High-level:  WebImage, CoinChangeController, ScrollMenuView
             ↓ depend on ↓
Abstractions: IImageDownloader, ICoinChangeService, IScrollMenuController
             ↓ implemented by ↓
Low-level:   ImageDownloader, CoinChangeService, ScrollMenuController
```

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

### No Main Thread Blocking

```
All file I/O      → System.IO (fast, synchronous — files are small PNGs)
All HTTP I/O      → UnityWebRequest in coroutine (never blocks Update())
Texture creation  → Main thread only (Unity requirement, unavoidable)
Cache dictionary  → Locked for thread safety
```

### Why Coroutines Over async/await

```
UnityWebRequest is NOT thread-safe.
Task.Run() + UnityWebRequest = crash.
Coroutines are Unity's sanctioned pattern for web I/O.
async/await is used only for pure C# code (no Unity objects).
```

### Memory Management

```
Textures created with makeNoLongerReadable: false
→ Keeps CPU-side copy for re-encoding to PNG (cache save)
→ Trade-off: slightly more RAM, but enables disk persistence

EncodeToPNG() called once after download
→ Normalizes JPEG/WebP to PNG (preserves alpha)
→ Cached PNG is always alpha-safe
```

### Scale Animation (CardScaleAnimator)

```csharp
// Runs in Update() — no coroutines, no allocations per frame
// Lerp approaches target asymptotically — naturally smooth stop
float newScale = Mathf.Lerp(current, target, Time.deltaTime \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* 10f);
// Avoids GC from Vector3 allocations by using scalar lerp
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_cardTransforms\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[i].localScale = Vector3.one \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* newScale;
```

## 🛡 Edge Cases Handled

### Coin Change

|Edge Case|Input|Output|Handling|
|-|-|-|-|
|Zero amount|`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[], 0`|`1`|Base case dp\[0]=1|
|Impossible|`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3,7], 5`|`0`|dp\[5] never updated|
|Null array|`null, 20`|`-1`|Null check at entry|
|Negative amount|`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1,5], -1`|`-1`|Validation at entry|
|Zero denomination|`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[0,5], 20`|`-1`|Per-coin validation|
|Large amount|`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1,2,5], 10000`|computed|`long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[]` prevents overflow|
|Duplicate denoms|`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[2,2,5], 10`|correct|DP handles naturally|

### Image Downloader

|Edge Case|Handling|
|-|-|
|Null or empty URL|Immediate failure callback, no request created|
|Same URL requested 5× simultaneously|Request coalescing — 1 download, 5 callbacks|
|Component destroyed mid-download|`if (this == null)` check before applying texture|
|Zero bytes downloaded|Explicit check, failure callback|
|Corrupt disk cache file|`LoadImage()` returns false → delete entry, re-download|
|Corrupt cache index JSON|Try/catch → reset index, continue|
|App quit during download|`OnApplicationQuit` cleans up, no crash|
|No internet|`isNetworkError` caught, fallback shown|
|HTTP 404 / 500|`responseCode` logged, failure callback|
|Cache directory missing|Auto-created on `CacheManager` init|

### Scroll Menu

|Edge Case|Handling|
|-|-|
|Swipe on first card (can't go left)|Controller clamps index, PREV button disabled|
|Swipe on last card (can't go right)|Controller clamps index, NEXT button disabled|
|Fast swipe before animation completes|Previous coroutine stopped, new one starts|
|Viewport width = 0 on first frame|Fallback to `Screen.width`|
|Zero cards|No crash — empty list handled|
|Drag without releasing|`OnEndDrag` not called — no snap until release|

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Task 1 — Coin Change

1. Open `CoinChangeTest` scene → Press **Play**
2. Click **Run Tests** → all 9+ test cases show green ✅
3. Manual test:

   * Notes: `1,5,10` | Amount: `20` → **9 Ways**
   * Notes: `3,7` | Amount: `5` → **0 Ways**
   * Notes: `1,5,10` | Amount: `0` → **1 Way**

### Task 2 — Scroll Menu

1. Open `ScrollMenuScene` → Press **Play**
2. In Game window, test each aspect ratio: `9:16`, `3:4`, `2:3`
3. Drag cards left/right with mouse → verify snap
4. Click NEXT/PREV → verify dot updates
5. Verify locked cards (6–10) show lock overlay

### Task 3 — Image Downloader

1. Open `ImageDownloaderScene` → Press **Play**
2. Click **📥 LOAD ALL** → observe queue counter (max 3 active)
3. Wait for all to load → click **🔄 RELOAD** → verify instant memory cache
4. Click **🗑 CLEAR CACHE** → Stop → Play → Load All → verify disk cache
5. Test custom URL input with any image URL
6. Test 10-second override: set `MaxConcurrentDownloads=1`, load 5 images, wait 10s

## ⚠️ Known Limitations \& Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

|Limitation|Description|Proposed Fix|
|-|-|-|
|No infinite scroll|Scroll menu has fixed card count|Implement circular buffer with recycled cells|
|No ETags/304|Cache invalidation is time-based only|Add HTTP ETag support for server-driven invalidation|
|Single scene downloader|ImageDownloader is DontDestroyOnLoad|Already handled — persists correctly across scenes|
|WebP not supported|Only PNG/JPEG via LoadImage|Add WebP decoder or platform-specific plugin|
|No download progress|No % progress events|Add `IProgress<float>` parameter to `RequestImage`|
|Memory cache unbounded|No max memory limit|Add LRU eviction with configurable max size|

### Planned Improvements

```
□ Virtual scroll list (recycle card GameObjects for 1000+ items)
□ Image placeholder shimmer animation while loading
□ HTTP ETag-based cache validation
□ Retry with exponential backoff on network failure
□ Download priority levels (foreground vs background)
□ Editor window for cache inspection and clearing
□ Unit test coverage via Unity Test Framework
□ Addressables integration for local asset fallback
```
